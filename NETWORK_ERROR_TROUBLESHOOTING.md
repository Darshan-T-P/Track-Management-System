# 🚨 Network Error Troubleshooting Guide

## **Current Errors:**
1. `ClientException: Failed to fetch, uri=https://www.google.com`
2. `DebugService: Error serving requestsError: Unsupported operation: Cannot send Null`

---

## 🔍 **Error Analysis**

### **Error 1: `ClientException: Failed to fetch`**
This error indicates that your Flutter app cannot make HTTP requests to external websites. This could be due to:

1. **Network connectivity issues**
2. **Firewall blocking HTTP requests**
3. **Flutter development environment issues**
4. **Proxy/VPN interference**

### **Error 2: `DebugService: Error serving requestsError: Unsupported operation: Cannot send Null`**
This error suggests there might be an issue with the Flutter development environment or network stack.

## 🛠️ **Immediate Solutions**

### **Solution 1: Use Network Diagnostic Tool**
I've created a comprehensive diagnostic tool. Navigate to `/network-diagnostic` in your app to run detailed tests.

### **Solution 2: Skip External Internet Check**
I've updated the ApiService to skip the external internet check and directly test your API server instead.

### **Solution 3: Test with Different Network**
Try running your app on:
- Different WiFi network
- Mobile hotspot
- Different device

---

## 🔧 **Code Changes Made**

### **1. Updated NetworkUtils**
- Added multiple connectivity test endpoints
- Added fallback connectivity tests
- Improved error handling

### **2. Updated ApiService**
- Skip external internet check
- Direct API server testing
- Better error messages

### **3. Added Diagnostic Screen**
- Comprehensive network testing
- Real-time diagnostic results
- Step-by-step troubleshooting

---

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### **Step 1: Run Network Diagnostics**
```dart
// Navigate to this route in your app
Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/network-diagnostic');
```

### **Step 2: Test API Directly**
The diagnostic tool will test:
- ✅ Basic connectivity
- ✅ API server reachability  
- ✅ Direct API calls
- ✅ Signup API functionality
- ✅ Flutter API service integration

### **Step 3: Check Results**
Look for these patterns in the diagnostic results:
- `✅` = Working correctly
- `❌` = Failed
- `⚠️` = Warning/partial success

## 🚀 **Quick Fixes to Try**

### **Fix 1: Restart Flutter Development Server**
```bash
# Stop the current Flutter app
# Then restart with:
flutter run
```

### **Fix 2: Clear Flutter Cache**
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### **Fix 3: Check Network Permissions**
Make sure your app has internet permissions in:
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- `ios/Runner/Info.plist`

### **Fix 4: Test on Different Network**
- Try mobile hotspot
- Try different WiFi
- Try different device

## 📱 **How to Use the Diagnostic Tool**

1. **Open your Flutter app**
2. **Navigate to `/network-diagnostic`**
3. **Tap "Run Diagnostics"**
4. **Review the results**

The diagnostic tool will show you exactly what's working and what's not.
